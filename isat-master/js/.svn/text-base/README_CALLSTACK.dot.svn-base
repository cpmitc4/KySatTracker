// Manually-generated graph topology.
// It starts with MATLAB but includes some JS compatibility stuff:
// compat, math_utils, test_utils.
// FWIW, Doxygen against MATLAB generates per-file/function calls.
// I use Graphviz for Mac GUI app to render.

// Shape and meaning:
// - circles (default) for MATLAB-defined functions
// - diamonds for MATLAB internals I may need to emulate
// - boxes for JS-specific additions
